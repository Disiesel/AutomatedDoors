Automated Doors 

The original author is Phate and the original version can be found at: http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/smapi-0-37-automatic-open-close-animal-doors-at-specific-time.109455/

I don't claim copyright or anything on the modded version either. I reverse engineered by decompiling and updated the code to the latest SMAPI standards. Thus the current 1.1.2 version still falls under copyright of the original author.

However 1.20 is based on Azah's work and thus I do not know how the copyright works at this time. I think we could consider this a group project now? :o
